It adeptly utilizes .xml files for both input and output operations, showcasing seamless data handling capabilities. The reservation system encompasses three distinct reservation categories: Cabin, Hotel, and House.

Key Features:

Versatile Data Handling: The system demonstrates its prowess in effectively reading from and writing to .xml files, ensuring efficient data management.

Diverse Reservation Types: Accommodating a range of reservation needs, the system encompasses three main reservation types: Cabin, Hotel, and House.

Unified Identification: The reservation system implements a unified system for generating unique IDs for both accounts and reservation numbers, enhancing organization and data tracking.

This repository serves as a demonstration of proficiency in Java programming and efficient data handling, showcasing the potential for building reservation systems that do not rely on traditional database setups. Feel free to explore and adapt the code to suit your specific use cases.
